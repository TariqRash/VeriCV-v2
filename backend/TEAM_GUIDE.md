- Manage authentication (JWT)  
- Design and maintain database schema  
- Write migrations, connect PostgreSQL later  
- Integrate file uploads & permissions  
- Build and maintain the **`quiz` app** (models: `Quiz`, `Question`, `Result`)  
- Create endpoints for quiz creation, retrieval, and result submission  
- Ensure smooth integration between AI-generated quiz content and database  
- Expose clean endpoints for frontend  

**Deliverables:**
- Verified `/api/*` endpoints (tested in Postman)  
- Clean ERD and migration files  
- Ready connection to cloud DB (Supabase / Render)  
- Functional quiz endpoints connected to AI pipeline

### 2. AI & Integration Engineer
**Focus:** Build and integrate the AI feedback and quiz generation layers  
**Main Tasks:**
- Extract CV text (PDF/DOCX parsing)  
- Connect backend to AI service (OpenAI / FastAPI / n8n)  
- Implement feedback generation pipeline  
- Prepare structured skill extraction (JSON output)  
- Generate skill-based **quiz questions** from analyzed CVs  
- Format and send quiz data to backend (JSON structure for storage)  
- Automate result evaluation and scoring logic  
- Optimize prompts and model parameters  

**Deliverables:**
- Working AI module (`ai_services.py` or separate service)  
- Endpoint that returns AI-generated feedback and quiz questions  
- Documentation of AI process (prompts, flow, and data structure)

### 3. Frontend Engineer
**Focus:** React-based user interface  
**Main Tasks:**
- Create `vericv_frontend` using Vite + React  
- Implement pages: Login, Dashboard, UploadCV, Feedback, **Quiz**  
- Handle authentication (token storage, refresh, logout)  
- Integrate API endpoints with Axios  
- Display AI feedback, quiz questions, and progress  
- Show quiz results and improvement suggestions  
- Maintain responsive, minimal design  

**Deliverables:**
- Functional UI with working upload + feedback + quiz flow  
- Connection to backend APIs  
- Deployed frontend (Netlify / Vercel)

## Branching Strategy (GitHub Flow)

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| `main` | Stable production-ready code |
| `dev` | Active integration branch |
| `feature/backend-api` | Backend work |
| `feature/ai-feedback` | AI & Quiz service work |
| `feature/frontend-ui` | Frontend work |

**Workflow**
1. Each developer works in their own `feature/*` branch.  
2. Push and create a **pull request** into `dev`.  
3. Team reviews and merges.  
4. Merge `dev` ‚Üí `main` when tested & stable.
